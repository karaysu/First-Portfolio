            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Raman Deep Singh and I am currently studying Computer Programming at Georgian College.</p>
            <p>Since I was a child I have been fascinated by video games, they were a way for me to escape into a world of fantasy
               where everything was possible. At first, my feeble mind couldn't fathom how these beautiful things came into being.
               I had no idea what was going behind that screen that was making it all possible, it was like magic to me, but as
               I grew older and become more knowledgeable about computers, video games, and other virtual applications, I realized
               it was all made possible due to a thing that is known as coding. It was all made possible by writing code which when
               I first looked at it didn't make any sense, but now when I am finally learning it and am being able to understand
               it, it is all making much more sense.
            </p>
            <p>The more I am learning about it, the more I realize how endless the possibilities are. The word of coding is just like
               an open ocean, the deeper you dive, the more you understand how much knowledge there is to gain and how vast this
               world is. With enough understanding and knowledge about what you are doing what you want to do, you can build anything
               you can think as long as you know what you are doing.
            </p>
            <p>After realizing what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, the next step was figuring out where I wanted to learn
               the skills I needed for that dream. After countless hours spent thinking about it, I finally chose Canada and Georgian
               College. Canada is a fantastic country, and I realized that the first day I came here. I loved so many things about
               this place, and more importantly, I liked my college where I was going to spend the next two years of my life. It
               doesn't really top Hogwarts but it a really great second choice. 
            </p>
            <p>So here I am trying to make my dreams come true. It's quite an adventure and slowly but surely I am getting closer
               to my goal, goal of being part of that gaming industry which has always inspired me. It may be a long road, but I
               am determined to keep moving forward and giving it my best.
            </p>
